Item List
  Uno, Mini USB cable, Computer, Breadboard, LM35 temperature sensor
  and 3 Jumper Cables

Background
  LM35 Temperature sensor will output .01V per degree Centigrade on the Vo pin
  Use ADC on the UNO to measure that voltage
    ADC on UNO will read any voltage from GND to VCC (5v) and convert to a digital number
  10 bit value proportional to the voltage applied
  Formula
    V=(ADC/1023)*VCC
      ADC is ADC value read
      VCC is the supply voltage(5v)
      V is the voltage applied to the ADC pin
    Convert Voltage to degrees Centigrade (LM35 output .01V per degree Centrigrade)
      dC = V *100
      V is the voltage on the Vo pin of the LM35 sensor
      dC is degrees Centigrade
    Combine the two equations by subing in V
    dC=(ADC/1023)*VCC*100
    dC=(ADC/1023)*500
      VCC=5

Writng the sketch
  Used from example
  /*
 * Tutorial 1: Reading Temperature
 * 
 * Read the temperature in celcius over serial.
 *
 *
 * To see this sketch in action open up the serial
 * monitor. Clamp your fingers over the LM35
 * sensor. The temperature will rise and then fall
 * as you remove your fingers.
 *
 * The circuit:
 * - LM35 to 5v, GND, and Vo to analog 0
 *

// the output pin of the LM35 temperature sensor
int lm35Pin = A0;

void setup()
{
    // set up serial at 9600 baud   
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop()
{ 
    int analogValue;
    float temperature;

    // read our temperature sensor
    analogValue = analogRead(lm35Pin);

    // convert the 10bit analog value to celcius
    temperature = float(analogValue) / 1023;
    temperature = temperature * 500;

    // print the temperature over serial
    Serial.print("Temp: ");
    Serial.print(temperature);
    Serial.println("C");
    
    // wait 1s before reading the temperature again
    delay(1000);

Questions:
  What does a breadboard do?
    A breadboard is a rectangular board with many mounting holes.
      They are used for creating electrical connections between electronic components and single board computers or microcontrollers such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
    The vertical columns of the breadboard are called terminals, while the horizontal long rows are called power rails because they are mostly used to connect the power supply to the breadboard. 
    The positive rails are indicated by red lines, while the negative rails are indicated by black ones.
    Breadboards are a soderless way to test a circuit (help you connect components to complete your basic circuit).

  Does the color matter for jumper cables?
    No, all jumper wires are the same. Advise use one set for positive connections and one set for negative connections.
  
  What is A0?
    An analog input pin

  What is GND?
    Negative of the Power supply.
