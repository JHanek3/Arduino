Automatically turn an LED on when its dark by reading the amount of light hiting a photocell

Background Information
  Continuing from #3, When its dark toggle an LED
  Uno has 14 digital pins that can be configureed as input or output
    Digital pin in output mode to drive an LED
  Output Mode, digitalWrite(LED, Low) will set the pin to 0V and digitalWrite(LED,High) will set the pin to VCC(5v)
  Resistor is needed to limit the current flow
    Typical LEDs are rated for up to 20 mA if forward current and have a forward voltage drop of 2V
  R = (VCC -Vf)/IF
    VCC = supply voltage (5v)
    Vf is LEDs forward voltage drop
    If is the LEDs forward voltage current
  Gives you a minimum resistor of 150 ohms
  Will be using a 330 ohm resistor
