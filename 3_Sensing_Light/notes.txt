Background Information
  A photocell behaves like a variable resistor. The more light applied to the photocell the less resistance it has.
  A0 reads voltages not resistancem beed a circuit to convert the phtocell's resistance into a voltage that can be read
  This is done by adding a fixed resistor in series with the photocell.
