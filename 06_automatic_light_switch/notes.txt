Automatically turn an LED when its dark by reading the amount of light hitting a photocell
  Uno has 14 digital pins that can be configured as input or output
    use a digital pin in output to drive an LED
    digitalWrite(LED, LOW) sets to 0v and digitalWrite(LED, HIGH) set VCC to 5v
  Resistor needed when using an LED to limit current flow
    typical leds are rated for up to 20mA and have a forward voltage drop of 2V
  To find minimum resistor value
    R = (VCC-Vf)/lf
    VCC = suplly voltage
    Vf is the LEDs forward voltage
    lf is the LEDs forward voltage current
    R = 5v - 2V /.020
      -> 150 ohms, instead we are going to use 330 ohms
