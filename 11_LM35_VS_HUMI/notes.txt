 Take the temperature of a room for x amount of time with the LM35 and HUMI-01 (dht11) and then plot a comparative line graph
  Serial communication between arduino and python will be used
  dht11 only reads integer values for temperatures so it will not be as accurate as LM35, making this comparisson kind of pointless.
