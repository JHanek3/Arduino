Relay:
  8-Channel 5V Relay Shield Module Board Optocoupler Module Arduino ARM PIC AVR

Use an arduino to control higher voltage devices
  use a relay to switch the current and then an arduino to control the relay

Arduino will be programmed for when a certain event occurs
  Any sensor can be used

5v Relay Terminals and Pins
  NC: Normally closed 120-240V terminal
  NO: Normally opened 120-240V terminal
  C: Common Terminal
  Ground: Connects to the ground pin on the Arduino
  5v VCC: Connects to the Arduino's 5V Pin
  Signal: Carries the tr5igger signal from the Arduino that activates the relay
  Inside the relay is a 120-240V switch that's connected to an electromagnet
    When the relay receives a HIGH signal at the signal pin, th electromagnet becomes charged and moves the contacts to the open or closed

Normally Open VS. Normally Closed
  Do you want the 5V signal to turn the switch on or off?
  The 120-240V supply current enters the relay at the common terminal in both configurations

Normally Open
  Relay receives a HIGH signal the 120-240V switch closes and allows current to flow from the C terminal to the NO terminal
  A low signal deactivates the relay and stops the current
  HIGH signal to turn ON the relay

Normally Closed
  HIGH signal opens the switch and interrupts the 120-240V current
  LOW signal closes the switch and allows current to flow from the C terminal to the NC terminal
  HIGH signal turn off the 120-240V current, use the normally closed terminal

Would like to use bluetooth instead of a photocell
